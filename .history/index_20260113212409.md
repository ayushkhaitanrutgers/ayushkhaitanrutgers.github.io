# Ayush Khaitan

Hill Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, New Brunswick  

I work in AI for mathematics, geometry, and combinatorics. 

I first got my bachelors in engineering at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani">BITS, Pilani</a>, and then completed a PhD in Mathematics at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University">Penn State</a>.

You can find my resume <a href= "https://ayushkhaitanrutgers.github.io/resume_web.pdf">here</a>. 

You can access my **Research**, **Publications**, **Teaching**, and **Research group** pages using the tabs above. 

I am co-organizing the [AI and Math seminar](https://ai-math-seminar.github.io/seminar/) at Rutgers.
