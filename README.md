My name is Ayush Khaitan, and I am a Hill Assistant Professor at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. Here is a [CV](CV.pdf).

I work on AI4Math, as well as problems in geometry and combinatorics. In particular, I am working on problems in combinatorics with [Bhargav Narayanan](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~narayanan/) and [Ishan Mata](https://sites.google.com/site/ishanmata), as well as running a research group with undergraduate students on using LLMs for Mathematics. We are currently trying to generalize the Alphageometry and Funsearch technologies to other fields of Mathematics. Check out our [research group](llmath.html) on LLMs and Mathematics to know more. 

I also organize the [LLM's and Mathematics seminar](seminar.html). 

During my PhD, I worked on conformal geometry and Ricci flow. The main result of my PhD was [constructing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02061) fully non-linear higher analogues of Perelman's F and W functionals, that will help study the Ricci flow in all dimensions. This result is the culmination of four papers [written](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11153) [during](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04719) [my](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06018) [PhD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02061). 

Along with [Swarat Chaudhari](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/) and [Amitayush Thakur](https://amit9oct.github.io), I have co-organized a panel titled ["The use of AI tools to aid Mathematics research"](https://ayushkhaitanrutgers.github.io/ai-tools-jmm) at the [Joint Mathematics Meetings, 2025](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) in Seattle. Here are the [notes](jmm.html) from the meeting.
