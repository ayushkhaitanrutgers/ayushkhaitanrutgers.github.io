My name is Ayush Khaitan, and I am a Hill Assistant Professor at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. Here is a [CV](CV.pdf). 

My current research interests are in conformal and CR geometry, Ricci flow, and mathematical physics. 

The main result of my PhD was [constructing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02061) fully non-linear higher analogues of Perelman's F and W functionals, that will help study the Ricci flow in all dimensions. This result is the culmination of four papers [written](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11153) [during](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04719) [my](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06018) [PhD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02061). 

Recently, I have also been working on problems in combinatorics with [Bhargav Narayanan](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~narayanan/) and [Ishan Mata](https://sites.google.com/site/ishanmata), as well as running a research group with around ten undergraduate students on using LLMs for Mathematics. We have been able to completely replicate DeepMind's Alpha Geometry and Funsearch technologies, and are currently trying to generalize them to other domains. Check out our [research group](llmath.html) on LLMs and Mathematics to know more.
