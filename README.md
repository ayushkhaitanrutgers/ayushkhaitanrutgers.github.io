My name is Ayush Khaitan, and I am a Hill Assistant Professor (postdoctoral) at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. 

Along with a group of around 12 undergraduate students, I have initiated a project to study how LLMs can be used to aid mathematical research. This page has been created to keep a record of our findings.
