My name is Ayush Khaitan, and I am a Hill Assistant Professor at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I got my PhD under [Jeffrey Case](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffreyscase) at Penn State University. Here is a [CV](New_CV1.pdf).

My research is in conformal geometry, problems in geometry and combinatorics, as well as AI4Math. In particular, I am working on problems in combinatorics with [Bhargav Narayanan](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~narayanan/) and [Ishan Mata](https://sites.google.com/site/ishanmata), as well as running a research group with undergraduate students on using LLMs for Mathematics. We are currently trying to generalize the Alphageometry and Funsearch technologies to other fields of Mathematics. Check out our [research group](llmath.html) on LLMs and Mathematics to know more. 

[Here](https://ricci-website.vercel.app) is a chatbot created by Mehaer Chhabda and Rohan Sharma to help mathematicians generate Ricci code for Mathematica.

I also organize the [LLM's and Mathematics seminar](seminar.html). 

The main result of my PhD was [constructing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02061) fully non-linear higher analogues of Perelman's F and W functionals, that will help study the Ricci flow in all dimensions. This result is the culmination of four papers [written](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11153) [during](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04719) [my](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06018) [PhD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02061). 

Along with [Swarat Chaudhari](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/) and [Amitayush Thakur](https://amit9oct.github.io), I co-organized a panel titled ["The use of AI tools to aid Mathematics research"](https://ayushkhaitanrutgers.github.io/ai-tools-jmm) at the [Joint Mathematics Meetings, 2025](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) in Seattle. Here are the [notes](jmm.html) from the meeting. 

I am teaching a graduate course in machine learning and developing LLMs for mathematical research this semester. The webpage for this course is [this](math_for_ai.html).

I am also teaching a course called Intro to Proofs. This is a course that will teach students how to write proofs in Lean. 

[Here](decompositions.html) we describe an AI tool that we have built to rigorously prove asymptotic inequalities. Using it, we answer a [question](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/05/01/a-proof-of-concept-tool-to-verify-estimates/) [of](https://mathoverflow.net/a/463940/91878) Terry Tao.
