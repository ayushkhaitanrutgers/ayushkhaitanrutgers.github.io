My name is Ayush Khaitan, and I am a Hill Assistant Professor (postdoctoral) at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. Here is a [CV](CV.pdf). 

My current research interests are in conformal and CR geometry, Ricci flow, and mathematical physics. 

Recently, I have also been working on problems in combinatorics with [Bhargav Narayanan](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~narayanan/), as well as running a research group with around ten undergraduate students on using LLMs for Mathematics. We have been able to completely replicate DeepMind's Alpha Geometry and Funsearch technologies, and are currently trying to generalize them to other domains. Check out our [research group](llmath.html) on LLMs and Mathematics to know more.
