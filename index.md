# Ayush Khaitan

Hill Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, New Brunswick  

I work in AI for mathematics, geometry, and combinatorics. 

I first got my bachelors in engineering at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani">BITS, Pilani</a>, and then completed a PhD in Mathematics at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University">Penn State</a>. I believe that my varied education and training have provided me with an ability to use tools from both pure and applied math, thereby helping me solve some of the problems that I'm most proud of. 

You can find my resume <a href= "https://ayushkhaitanrutgers.github.io/resume.pdf">here</a>.
