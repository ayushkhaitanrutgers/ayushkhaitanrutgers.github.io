        The <a href="https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2025/meetingapp.cgi/Session/11074">JMM panel</a>, titled 
        “The use of AI tools in Mathematics research,” was organized by 
        <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/">Swarat Chaudhuri</a>, 
        <a href="https://ayushkhaitanrutgers.github.io">Ayush Khaitan</a> and 
        <a href="https://amit9oct.github.io/aboutme/">Amitayush Thakur</a>. 
        It brought together leading mathematicians and computer scientists working in the field of AI and mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The motivation for the panel was two-fold: 
        (1) to let these experts describe the current state of AI adoption in mathematics research, and 
        (2) for the computer science community to gain a deeper understanding of the tools 
        that would be most useful for mathematicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given below are some highlights from our panel discussion.
        Any factual errors are the author’s alone.

    <h2>Panelists</h2>
    <ul class="panelists">
      <li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1tMnd-4AAAAJ&hl=en">Francois Charton</a> (FAIR, Meta)</li>
      <li><a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=WXG0QfMAAAAJ&hl=en">Thomas Hubert</a> (Google DeepMind)</li>
      <li><a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~alexk/">Alex Kontorovich</a> (Rutgers University)</li>
      <li><a href="https://yangky11.github.io">Kaiyu Yang</a> (FAIR, Meta)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Before the discussion began, the moderator welcomed the panelists and explained the structure of the panel.
      The moderator would ask questions either to a particular panelist or to all panelists collectively.
      The panelists were free to answer both types of questions, and they were encouraged to share
      technical insights from their own research to provide context.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>On the current use of AI tools in Mathematics Research</h3>
    <p>
      The discussion began by asking all the panelists about the kinds of AI tools currently being utilized
      in mathematics research. Alex highlighted that foundational large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT
      and Claude are widely used by mathematicians. He likened discussing research ideas with a powerful LLM
      to chatting with an expert during tea time in a math department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex also mentioned that tools such as Lean are slowly gaining traction, along with FunSearch, AlphaGeometry, 
      and PatternBoost. He noted that while DeepMind is developing the Alpha family of technologies, access to 
      these tools by mathematics professors could significantly help their research programs. Thomas agreed 
      that open access to similar technologies would be helpful to mathematicians at universities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francois Charton then shared his experience from a semester-long workshop at Harvard CMSA,
      where he assisted in solving complicated math problems using basic Transformers.
      He emphasized that Transformers can grasp complex mathematical concepts and provide 
      solutions that might be challenging even for professional mathematicians.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>On Funsearch and PatternBoost</h3>
    <p>
      Moving on to the application of FunSearch and PatternBoost, the panel discussed their use in constructing
      examples and counterexamples in combinatorics. Francois noted that combinatorics is often more amenable 
      to such methods due to finite search spaces. However, extending these methods to fields like differential
      geometry or analysis poses challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moderator suggested that even in geometry, where there might be a finite list of manifolds to consider, 
      automation using LLMs coupled with FunSearch or PatternBoost could be feasible. Francois agreed, proposing
      that geometry problems might be tackled by dividing manifolds into finite components, a possible avenue
      for future work.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>On AlphaProof and the IMO</h3>
    <p>
      The conversation then shifted to AlphaProof, an AI tool that is “almost” at the proficiency of a gold medalist 
      at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Thomas expressed that grounding LLMs with formal theorem 
      provers like Lean is expected to bring major progress to research-level problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clarified that while AlphaProof had been trained on IMO problems, it was trained in a manner resembling 
      a human studying for these competitions, rather than simply memorizing large datasets of solutions. This 
      approach, he said, holds promise for tackling research-level math problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kaiyu Yang elaborated on AlphaProof’s performance, noting it solved 4 out of 6 problems at the 2024 IMO. 
      The two unsolved combinatorics problems involved non-standard words like “monsters,” which complicated
      translation into Lean. Kaiyu posited that a more standard phrasing of the questions might have allowed
      AlphaProof to do even better, and that the integration of LLMs with formal theorem provers holds promise
      for handling the toughest problems in mathematics.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Do LLMs actually understand mathematics?</h3>
    <p>
      Addressing the skepticism around LLMs’ understanding of mathematical concepts, Francois Charton argued 
      that mathematical formulas can be encoded as sentences. In his Harvard CMSA research, he demonstrated 
      that transformers could translate mathematical questions and formulas into answers—much like translating 
      English into French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Alex Kontorovich compared ChatGPT’s ability to play chess merely by “reading” about the game, 
      raising doubts about whether LLMs have deeper understanding. Francois maintained, however, that transformers
      can reliably solve most mathematical problems and logical puzzles on which they are adequately trained
      or fine-tuned.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      The panel concluded with an electric atmosphere, as the experts wove intuitive explanations and technical 
      details into their answers for the ~100 mathematicians and computer scientists in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end, there was a palpable feeling that something fundamental has changed about the nature of 
      mathematics research—and that this certainly won’t be the last discussion panel on AI tools in math.
