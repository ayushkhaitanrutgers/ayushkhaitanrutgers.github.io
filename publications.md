# Publications

Below is a list of my publications, with brief summaries of each.

## Paper 1: *An LLM–CAS framework for proving asymptotic inequalities*  
**Authors:** Ayush Khaitan, [Vijay Ganesh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh)  
**Venue / Year / arXiv link:** ICLR 2026 (submitted), 2025 — [arXiv:2510.12350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12350)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We build an LLM+CAS framework that allows us to prove research-level asymptotic inequalities.  
> Using this framework, we resolve multiple open questions from MathOverflow and other research forums.  
> This work answers a question posed by Terence Tao, demonstrating that such an automated reasoning tool can indeed be built.

## Paper 2: *Elementary symmetric polynomials under the fixed point measure*  
**Authors:** Ayush Khaitan, [Bhargav Narayanan](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~narayanan/), [Ishan Mata](https://sites.google.com/site/ishanmata)  
**Venue / Year / arXiv link:** Submitted, 2025 — [arXiv:2505.12178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12178)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We prove a surprising inhomogeneous inequality satisfied by symmetric polynomials, thereby fully proving a conjecture of Bhargav Narayanan.  
> This result partially solves the long-standing problem of finding sharp unconditional lower bounds on the permanent of a matrix.

## Paper 3: *Computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincaré–Einstein manifolds*  
**Authors:** [Jeffrey Case](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffreyscase), [Yueh-Ju Lin](https://sites.google.com/view/yuehjulin), [Aaron Tyrrell](https://aaron-tyrrell.com), [Wei Yuan](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=241215), Ayush Khaitan  
**Venue / Year / arXiv link:** Submitted, 2024 — [arXiv:2404.11319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11319)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We describe a general procedure for constructing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincaré–Einstein manifolds.  
> The approach provides a systematic framework for obtaining explicit curvature formulas and for studying their geometric and analytic properties.

## Paper 4: *Ambient metric for manifolds with density and the Ricci flow*  
**Authors:** Ayush Khaitan  
**Journal / Year / arXiv link:** *Advances in Mathematics* (accepted), 2023 — [arXiv:2308.02061](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02061)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We construct fully non-linear analogues of Perelman's \( \mathcal{W} \)-functional that are monotone along the Ricci flow and stationary only for shrinking Ricci solitons.  
> The construction arises naturally from the Fefferman–Graham ambient metric adapted to manifolds with density.

## Paper 5: *The weighted ambient metric*  
**Authors:** [Jeffrey S. Case](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jqc5026/), Ayush Khaitan  
**Journal / Year / link:** *SIGMA* **18** (2022), 086, 21 pages — [Journal link](https://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/2022/086/)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We construct the Fefferman–Graham ambient metric for smooth metric measure spaces, extending the classical conformal construction to a weighted geometric setting.  
> This serves as the foundation for later work on weighted curvature invariants and generalized conformal geometry.

## Paper 6: *GJMS operators of smooth metric measure spaces*  
**Authors:** Ayush Khaitan  
**Venue / Year / arXiv link:** Submitted, 2022 — [arXiv:2203.04719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04719)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We construct GJMS operators associated to smooth metric measure spaces, generalizing the conformal family of conformally covariant differential operators to the weighted case.  
> The results connect conformal geometry, analysis on manifolds with density, and the ambient metric framework.

## Paper 7: *Weighted renormalized volume coefficients*  
**Authors:** Ayush Khaitan  
**Venue / Year / arXiv link:** Submitted, 2022 — [arXiv:2205.06018](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06018)  
**Summary / Notes:**  
> We construct the renormalized volume coefficients associated with smooth metric measure spaces and establish several of their key analytic and geometric properties.  
> These coefficients play a central role in extending conformal and renormalization techniques to the weighted geometric setting.
