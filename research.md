# Research

My research spans:

- Conformal geometry, Ricci flow, geometric analysis  
- Combinatorics and analytic inequalities  
- AI-for-Math tools: using LLMs, proof assistants, verified inequality solvers  

Here are some of my active themes and project directions:

| Theme | Short Description |
|---|---|
| Higher analogues of Perelmanâ€™s \(F\) and \(W\) functionals | Explore monotonicity, soliton solutions, curvature flows in higher dimension / non-linear settings |
| Verified inequalities and asymptotic tools | Build frameworks (LLM+CAS hybrid) to rigorously prove asymptotic inequalities |
| AI + Geometry crossover | Applying machine learning / symbolic methods to problems in geometry, curvature bounds, rigidity |

You can see my full list of publications and then for each, read a summary in the **Publications** tab.
